# Differences with Redis
## String lengths, indices.
String sizes are limited to 256MB.
Indices (say in GETRANGE and SETRANGE commands) should be signed 32 bit integers in range
[-2147483647, 2147483648].
### String handling.
SORT does not take any locale into account.
## Expiry ranges.
Expirations are limited to 4 years. For commands with millisecond precision like PEXPIRE or PSETEX,
expirations greater than 2^27ms are quietly rounded to the nearest second loosing precision of less than 0.001%.
## Lua
We use lua 5.4.4 that has been released in 2022.
That means we also support [lua integers](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/5261).
