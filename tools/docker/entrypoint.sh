They are provided by a third-party and are governed by

separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support

documentation.

💁 The OpenShift Starter workflow will:

- Checkout your repository

- Perform a container image build

- Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (gc/h-ref.1mvnr-)

- Log in to your OpenShift cluster

- Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

ℹ️ Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:

1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try

2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:

- https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme

- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets

- https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set

3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with '🖊️' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.

4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.

The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,

but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.

5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

This workflow will build and push a new container image to Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (ACR),

and then will deploy it to Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK), when there is a push to the "paradice" branch.

To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:

1. Create an ACR repository to store your container images.

You can use ACR EE instance for more security and better performance.

For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/142168.htm

2. Create an ACK cluster to run your containerized application.

You can use ACK Pro cluster for more security and better performance.

For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/95108.htm

3. Store your AccessKey pair in GitHub Actions secrets named ACCESS_KEY_ID and ACCESS_KEY_SECRET.

For instructions on setting up secrets see: https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/

4. Change the values for the REGION_ID, REGISTRY, NAMESPACE, IMAGE, ACK_CLUSTER_ID, and ACK_DEPLOYMENT_NAME.

This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,

and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when there is a push to the "paradice" branch.

To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:

1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.

For example: aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2.

Replace the value of the ECR_REPOSITORY environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's name.

Replace the value of the AWS_REGION environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's region.

2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.

For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:

https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun

Replace the value of the ECS_SERVICE environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the Amazon ECS service.

Replace the value of the ECS_CLUSTER environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the cluster.

3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.

The format should follow the output of aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton.

Replace the value of the ECS_TASK_DEFINITION environment variable in the workflow below with the path to the JSON file.

Replace the value of the CONTAINER_NAME environment variable in the workflow below with the name of the container

in the containerDefinitions section of the task definition.

4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,

and best practices on handling the access key credentials.

This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.

They are provided by a third-party and are governed by

separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support

documentation.

💁 The OpenShift Starter workflow will:

- Checkout your repository

- Perform a container image build

- Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

- Log in to your OpenShift cluster

- Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

ℹ️ Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:

1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try

2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:

- https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme

- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets

- https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set

3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with '🖊️' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.

4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.

The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,

but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.

5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

📫 How to reach me # npm Documentation

￼

This is the documentation for
https://docs.npmjs.com/.

This repository contains the
content for our documentation site, and the GitHub Actions workflows
that generate the site itself.

Quick start

npm install to download gatsby, our theme, and the dependencies

npm run develop: starts the test server at http://localhost:8000.

Update the content - it's Mdx, which is like markdown - in the content
directory.

Review your content at http://localhost:8000. (Gatsby watches the
filesystem and will reload your content changes immediately.)

Once you're happy, commit it and open a pull request at
https://github.com/npm/documentation.

A CI workflow run will publish your PR to a GitHub Preview Page.

Pulls Request

---branches": "-'[' trunk' ']":,

If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. For more information, see "Creating a pull request from a fork" and "About forks."

You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request. Pull requests can only be opened between two branches that are different.

{% data reusables.pull_requests.perms-to-open-pull-request %}

{% data reusables.pull_requests.close-issues-using-keywords %}

Changing the branch range and destination repository

By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch. For more information, see "About branches."

If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.

￼

When thinking about branches, remember that the base branch is where changes should be applied, the head branch contains what you would like to be applied.

When you change the base repository, you also change notifications for the pull request. Everyone that can push to the base repository will receive an email notification and see the new pull request in their dashboard the next time they sign in.

When you change any of the information in the branch range, the Commit and Files changed preview areas will update to show your new range.

{% tip %}

Tips:

Using the compare view, you can set up comparisons across any timeframe. For more information, see "Comparing commits."

Project maintainers can add a pull request template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information in the body of a pull request. For more information, see "About issue and pull request templates."

{% endtip %}

Creating the pull request

{% webui %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}

In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.

￼

{% data reusables.repositories.new-pull-request %}

Use the base branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.

￼

{% data reusables.repositories.pr-title-description %}

{% data reusables.repositories.create-pull-request %}

{% data reusables.repositories.asking-for-review %}

After your pull request has been reviewed, it can be merged into the repository.

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

{% data reusables.cli.cli-learn-more %}

To create a pull request, use the gh pr create subcommand.

gh pr create 

To assign a pull request to an individual, use the --assignee or -a flags. You can use @me to self-assign the pull request.

gh pr create --assignee "@octocat" 

To specify the branch into which you want the pull request merged, use the --base or -B flags. To specify the branch that contains commits for your pull request, use the --head or -H flags.

gh pr create --base my-base-branch --head my-changed-branch 

To include a title and body for the new pull request, use the --title and --body flags.

gh pr create --title "The bug is fixed" --body "Everything works again" 

To mark a pull request as a draft, use the --draft flag.

gh pr create --draft 

To add a labels or milestones to the new pull request, use the --label and --milestone flags.

gh pr create --label "bug,help wanted" --milestone octocat-milestone 

To add the new pull request to a specific project, use the --project flag.

gh pr create --project octocat-project 

To assign an individual or team as reviewers, use the --reviewer flag.

gh pr create --reviewer monalisa,hubot --reviewer myorg/team-name 

To create the pull request in your default web browser, use the --web flag.

gh pr create --web
